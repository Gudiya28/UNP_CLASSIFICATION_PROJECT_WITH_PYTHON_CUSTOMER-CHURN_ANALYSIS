# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_CUSTOMER-CHURN_ANALYSIS

As part of my coursework at United Network of Professionals, I worked on a Classification Project using Python focused on predicting customer churn based on telecom usage data. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing — removing duplicates, handling outliers using the IQR method, and converting categorical variables into numerical form. I performed exploratory data analysis to identify key churn indicators such as frequency of usage, complaints, tariff plans, and customer status through visualizations and correlation analysis. Three machine learning algorithms — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier — were applied to build predictive models. Their performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with the Random Forest model delivering the best results. This project strengthened my understanding of classification modeling, feature engineering, and model evaluation, and enhanced my hands-on skills in Python for business-focused analytics.
